                In the gritty streets of NYC, Jay sits at his cluttered desk, eyes locked on his laptop screen as he

                potential in cryptocurrency as a way out of the hood's traditional hustles. Alone on his rooftop that

                do... but neither was the hood."

                Jay gathers his crew—Dante, Mike, Kiki, and Ronny—at the park to pitch his cryptocurrency vision.
                Despite jokes and skepticism, Jay passionately explains how they could create their own token, giving
                the hood ownership and economic power. When Kiki questions crowdfunding, Dante reveals that Ronny has
                been asking questions about the project. Jay focuses his pitch directly on Ronny, comparing crypto's
                legitimacy to the dangers of street hustling. Though Ronny sees potential, he needs guarantees that Jay
                can't provide.
